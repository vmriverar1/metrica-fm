# Hero Transform Implementation Test

## Implementation Completed ✅

### What was implemented:

1. **New HeroTransform Component** (`/src/components/landing/hero-transform.tsx`)
   - Progressive height reduction from 100vh to 25vh on scroll
   - Background image zoom (1 to 1.2) and blur (0 to 8px) effects
   - Title scaling (1 to 0.7) and repositioning
   - Subtitle and CTA fade out on scroll
   - Next section (Stats) emergence from bottom
   - Pin scrolling with ScrollTrigger for smooth transformation

2. **Updated page.tsx**
   - Replaced `Hero` with `HeroTransform` component
   - Import path updated to use the new component

### Key Features:

- **Scroll-based transformation**: The hero section transforms progressively as you scroll
- **Pinned scrolling**: The hero stays fixed while transforming, creating a cinematic effect
- **Responsive design**: Different behaviors for mobile (< 768px) and desktop
- **Performance optimized**: Uses GSAP's ScrollTrigger with scrub for smooth 60fps animations

### Test Instructions:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:9002
2. Scroll down slowly from the top
3. Observe the following transformations:
   - Hero section shrinks from full viewport to 25vh
   - Background image zooms and blurs
   - Title scales down and moves to left
   - Subtitle and button fade out
   - Stats section emerges from bottom

### Expected Behavior:

- Smooth transformation without janky animations
- Header should remain visible above the hero
- Stats section should smoothly emerge as hero shrinks
- On mobile, transformations should be more subtle

### Notes:

- The implementation follows the Turner & Townsend inspiration but adapted to Métrica's design
- Uses GSAP ScrollTrigger for performance and browser compatibility
- All animations are GPU-accelerated using transform and opacity
